# flashcards

## Dependencies

- npm

If you have npm installed I _think_ you can get away with just running

```
npm install
```

In any case, I have used Next.js with a JSON server.

## Initialise DB

Move [this](https://github.com/sergiosja/flashcards/blob/main/db.json) file into the data folder

## Run

Spin up the "database" API with

```
npm run server
```

and the client with

```
npm run client
```

## What's this anyway?

I wanted to try out flashcards to help me study, but wasn't satisfied with the OG paper stuff. After checking out a couple of web options I figured they were all bloated. Therefore I created the tiniest flashcards web-app I could imagine ðŸ˜„

## TODO:

- Delete cards
- Delete categories
- Delete topics

- Edit cards
- Edit categories
- Edit topics

- Add another page for instructions? Perhaps make this an "oracle site" where you can delete/edit stuff as well.
